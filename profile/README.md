## Kia ora, welcome to Govt Geo Data Crawl ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ ðŸ—º

Here we host repos of geospacial data from various New Zealand Govt departments â€“Â mainly LINZ. 

Public repositories contain data mostly licenced under CC BY 3.0/4.0 licences. Private repos may contain full copyrightable all rights reserved data â€“ read the licence file before using. Under no circumstances should RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and/or TOP SECRET security classified data be stored on this organisation account, public or private.

Cloning whole repositories allow you to quickly access all the data without going through data services or ESRI endpoints. It is designed for users who use most if not all the dataset, not somewone who's only after one subset.
